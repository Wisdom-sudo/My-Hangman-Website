    <p>What is scrum?</p>
    <p>Scrum is a project management framework of agile that helps with teamwork it is used to develop, deliver and sustain products. Scrum and agile are often used interchangeably however this is wrong due to the fact that scrum is a framework for getting things done and constantly shipping value to customers while agile is just a set of values and principles basically a way of thinking. Scrum is the methodology and how you would implement agile ways of thinking and practices.
        Scrum software is built in a series of iterations called sprints where large projects are broken down into small and manageable pieces.
