    <p>What is scrum?</p>

    <p>Scrum is a project management framework of agile that helps with teamwork it is used to develop, deliver and sustain products. Scrum and agile are often used interchangeably however this is wrong due to the fact that scrum is a framework for getting things done and constantly shipping value to customers while agile is just a set of values and principles basically a way of thinking. Scrum is the methodology and how you would implement agile ways of thinking and practices.
        Scrum software is built in a series of iterations called sprints where large projects are broken down into small and manageable pieces.</p> 
        <p>What is a sprint? </p>
        
        <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.</p>
       
        <p>Sprint planning is a collaborative effort of teams to work together and answer two basic questions. What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?
            The right work is chosen by the product owner, scrum master and the development team.
            The product owner decides what path the development process should take and what the final product should look like. The dev team then creates a plan for how they will create backlog items and get them done. The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the sprint backlog. 
            
            During a sprint teams check during their daily scrum/standup and discuss how the work is progressing. The objective of such a meeting is to identify any blockers that would hinder the team's ability to deliver on the sprint goal. After a sprint the team showcases what they have completed during the sprint review. This process finally completed during the sprint retrospective where the team reflects on areas where improvements could be made for the next sprint.
