    <p id="SCRUM">What is scrum?</p>

    <p>Scrum is a project management framework of agile that helps with teamwork it is used to develop, deliver and sustain products. Scrum and agile are often used interchangeably however this is wrong due to the fact that scrum is a framework for getting things done and constantly shipping value to customers while agile is just a set of values and principles basically a way of thinking. Scrum is the methodology and how you would implement agile ways of thinking and practices.
        Scrum software is built in a series of iterations called sprints where large projects are broken down into small and manageable pieces.</p> 

        <p id="SPRINT">What is a sprint? </p>
 
        <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work.</p>
       
        <p>Sprint planning is a collaborative effort of teams to work together and answer two basic questions. What work can get done in this sprint and how will the chosen work get done?
            The right work is chosen by the product owner, scrum master and the development team.
            The product owner decides what path the development process should take and what the final product should look like. The dev team then creates a plan for how they will create backlog items and get them done. The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the sprint backlog. 
            
            During a sprint teams check during their daily scrum/standup and discuss how the work is progressing. The objective of such a meeting is to identify any blockers that would hinder the team's ability to deliver on the sprint goal. After a sprint the team showcases what they have completed during the sprint review. This process finally completed during the sprint retrospective where the team reflects on areas where improvements could be made for the next sprint.

         <p>What is a backlog?</p>

         <p>A product backlog is a priorities list of work for the development team that is dervied from the roadmap and its requirments. The most improtant items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first. The development team doesn't work through the backlog at the product owners pace and the product owner isn't pushing work to the development team. Instead, the development team pulls work from the product backlog as there is capacity for it, either continually kanban or by iteration scrum.</p>

         <p>What is a sprint review?</p>

         <p>Sprint reviews are not retrospectives. A sprint review is about demonstrating the hard work of the entire team: designers, developers, and the product owner. At Atlassian we like to keep our sprint reviews casual. Team members gather around a desk for informal demos and describe the work they’ve done for that iteration. It’s a time to ask questions, try new features, and give feedback. Sharing in success is an important part of building an agile team.</p>

         <p>What are standups?</p>

         <p>In many sports like (American) football and rugby, the team huddles before each play. The huddle is strategic: it keeps the team informed, connected, and calibrated throughout the game. For software teams, the stand-up is like the team’s huddle. It’s even commonly known as the daily scrum, and reinforces “we” to keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.</p>
